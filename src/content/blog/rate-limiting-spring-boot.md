Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory key-value data store that supports a variety of data structures like strings, lists, sets, hashes, and more. Itâ€™s highly performant due to its in-memory architecture, which makes it an excellent choice for caching and session management in modern applications.
